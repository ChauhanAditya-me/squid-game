# Development & Debug Files

This folder contains scripts and files used for debugging, development, or testing purposes. These are not part of the main production website and should not be referenced in production HTML or JS files.

- `script-fixed.js`: Example debug script.

Move any future test or debug scripts here to keep the main frontend clean.
